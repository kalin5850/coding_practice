"""
Some people are standing in a row in a park. There are trees between them which cannot be moved. Your task is to rearrange the people by their heights in a non-descending order without moving the trees. People can be very tall!

Example

For a = [-1, 150, 190, 170, -1, -1, 160, 180], the output should be
solution(a) = [-1, 150, 160, 170, -1, -1, 180, 190].

Input/Output

[execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

[memory limit] 1 GB

[input] array.integer a

If a[i] = -1, then the ith position is occupied by a tree. Otherwise a[i] is the height of a person standing in the ith position.

Guaranteed constraints:
1 â‰¤ a.length â‰¤ 1000,
-1 â‰¤ a[i] â‰¤ 1000.

[output] array.integer

Sorted array a with all the trees untouched.
